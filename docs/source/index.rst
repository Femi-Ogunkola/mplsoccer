mplsoccer
=========

`mplsoccer` is a Python library for drawing soccer/football pitches in Matplotlib and loading StatsBomb open-data.

-----------
Quick start
-----------

Use the package manager `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ to install mplsoccer.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install mplsoccer

Plot a StatsBomb pitch:

.. code-block:: python

    from mplsoccer.pitch import Pitch
    pitch = Pitch(pitch_color='grass', line_color='white', stripe=True)
    fig, ax = pitch.draw()

Why mplsoccer exists?
---------------------

mplsoccer shares some of the tools I built for the OptaPro Analytics Forum.
At the time there weren't any open-sourced python tools.
Now alternatives exist, such as `matplotsoccer <https://pypi.org/project/matplotsoccer/>`_

By using mplsoccer, I hope that you can spend more time building insightful graphics rather than having to learn to draw pitches from scratch.

-----------------------
Advantages of mplsoccer
-----------------------

mplsoccer:

1) draws 7 different pitch types by changing a single argument, which is useful as there isn't a standardised data format
2) extends matplotlib to plot heatmaps, (comet) lines, footballs and rotated markers
3) flips the data coordinates when in a vertical orientation so you donâ€™t need to remember to flip them
4) creates tidy dataframes for StatsBomb data, which is useful as most of the alternatives produce nested dataframes

Contributions
-------------

Contributions are welcome. It would be great to add the following functionality to mplsoccer:

- pass maps
- pass sonars

I would also welcome more examples in the gallery to help others.

Inspiration

mplsoccer was inspired by other people's work:

- `Peter McKeever <http://petermckeever.com/2019/01/plotting-pitches-in-python/>`_ inspired the API design
- `ggsoccer <https://github.com/Torvaney/ggsoccer>`_ is a library for plotting pitches in R
- `lastrow <https://twitter.com/lastrowview>`_ often tweets animations and the accompanying code
- `fcrstats <http://fcrstats.com/>`_ has some great tutorials for using football data
- `fcpython <https://fcpython.com/>`_ also has some great tutorials in Python
- `Karun Singh <https://twitter.com/karun1710>`_ tweets some interesting football analytics and visuals
- `StatsBomb <https://statsbomb.com/>`_ has great visual designs and free open-data
- John Burn-Murdoch's `tweet <https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1057907312030085120>`_ got me interested in football analytics
