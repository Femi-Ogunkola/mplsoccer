====================
Plot rotated markers
====================

This example shows how to plot rotated markers.

Warning: The rotation angle is in degrees and assumes the original marker is pointing upwards ↑.
If it's not you will have to modify the rotation degrees.
Rotates the marker in degrees, clockwise. 0 degrees is facing the direction of play (left to right).
In a horizontal pitch, 0 degrees is this way →, in a vertical pitch, 0 degrees is this way ↑
